device_factory.py — make the simulated devices the study reads.  LIBRARY ONLY.

There is no command line here on purpose; the programs you run live in
scripts/ and all start with run_.

One device folder is:

    <pool>/sample_<i>/
        numpy/simulation/
            charge_sensing_data.npy   the measurement (what a sensor sees)
            double_dot_data.npy       the charge-state-change map
            charge_states.npy         the integer occupation (n1, n2) per pixel
            ground_truth_labels.npy   the answer the network is trained against
        device.json                   capacitances, window, charge stats

TWO GUARANTEES THIS FILE PROVIDES
─────────────────────────────────
1.  Every device in the pool is an UNFILTERED capacitance draw.  There is no
    acceptance test of any kind — nothing looks at the simulated diagram and
    asks whether it is a honeycomb.  Whatever the simulator produces enters
    the dataset, so the pool is a plain sample of the capacitance space.
    A draw is lost only when the simulator itself raises.

2.  Every device is a different device.  Besides the 13 independent
    capacitance draws, the swept gate-voltage WINDOW is randomly offset per
    device, which slides the honeycomb lattice relative to the image frame.
    Without that offset every diagram is phase-locked to the same origin and
    the whole dataset shares one alignment — a large part of why the previous
    training set "all looked the same".

generate() is RESUMABLE and never overwrites: a device that already has its
device.json and ground truth is skipped.  Pointing it at a full folder is
free, and asking for more devices than are there only makes the missing ones.

    The canonical folder name for a device pool, e.g.

        pool_name(1000, 100, cfg)  ->  "devices_n1000_res100_c1df7b6bf"

    ONE pool.  Train and test devices are drawn from the same distribution
    and live side by side; which of them is which is decided afterwards, by
    ID, in study/device_split.py.  Nothing about a device says which side it
    is on, so a device cannot be generated onto the wrong side.

    The trailing fingerprint is a hash of the exact capacitance intervals, so
    changing the parameter space changes the folder name.  Devices simulated
    under one set of intervals can then never be silently reused under
    another — the most expensive mistake available in this project.
