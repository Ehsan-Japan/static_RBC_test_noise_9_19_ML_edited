"""
figure_style.py — one place that decides how big every saved figure is.

For a paper the images have to be directly comparable, which means three
things must be identical from figure to figure:

  1. the canvas size in inches and the dpi  -> every file has the same
     physical size and the same pixel dimensions;
  2. the position of the plotting box inside that canvas -> the data area
     lands in the same place in every image, so figures can be stacked or
     placed side by side and the axes line up;
  3. the data-to-inches scale -> equal aspect plus the same voltage limits
     means 1 mV is the same number of millimetres on paper everywhere.

Previously each module picked its own figsize ((8,6), (10,8), (10,10),
(12,12), (14,6) …) and most saved with ``bbox_inches="tight"``, which crops
the canvas to whatever the labels happened to need — so no two images came
out the same size.  Nothing here uses "tight": the figure is saved exactly
as declared, and the fixed axes rectangle leaves room for the labels.

Usage
-----
    from ..config.figure_style import new_map_figure, save_figure

    fig, ax, cax = new_map_figure(with_colorbar=True)
    im = ax.imshow(...)
    fig.colorbar(im, cax=cax, label="Sensor Signal")
    save_figure(fig, out_path)

Multi-panel figures use ``new_figure(ncols=2)``: the canvas widens so each
panel keeps the same physical size as a single-panel figure.

Set the size ONCE at the start of the program — scripts/run_simulation.py
passes figure_width_in / figure_height_in / plot_dpi to DatasetPipeline,
which calls :func:`set_figure_style`.
