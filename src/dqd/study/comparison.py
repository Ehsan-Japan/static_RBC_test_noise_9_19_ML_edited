"""
comparison.py — stage 4: every configuration side by side.

Reads the metrics.json each configuration's stage 3 wrote and answers the
question the whole study exists for:

    how many rays, at what ray resolution, does it take to recover the
    transition lines?

Writes into a folder named after the sweep, so different setups never
overwrite each other:

    results/3-4-5_rays_50_points_500_samples/       a ray sweep
    results/5-7-8_rays_20-50_points_500_samples/    rays and points
    results/3_rays_50_points_100-500_samples/       a data-size sweep
        comparison.csv        one row per configuration
        comparison.txt        the same as a readable table
        figures/              the gallery — see model_figures.py

The name is a pure function of the sweep, so re-running the same one updates
its folder rather than piling up copies, and two different sweeps can never
land in the same place.

Nothing is retrained and nothing existing is touched: this reads finished
results and adds a folder.  Configurations that have not been evaluated yet
are listed as missing rather than silently dropped, so a half-finished sweep
cannot quietly become a complete-looking figure.

Two configurations are only comparable if everything except the budget is
the same.  The table therefore carries the split mode, the resolution and
the training-set size in every row, and the comparison warns when they are
not constant across the rows being plotted.
