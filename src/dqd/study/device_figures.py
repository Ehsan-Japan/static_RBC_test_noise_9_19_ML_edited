device_figures.py — the per-device pictures, back, and under your control.

The bulk generator keeps only the arrays: 2500 devices times a dozen figures
is gigabytes nothing reads.  But the arrays ARE the figures — everything a
per-device picture shows can be re-rendered from them at any time, at any
dpi, for whichever devices you actually want.  That is what this module does.

Every figure is drawn in the ONE house style from dqd.config.figure_style —
white background, black cell grid, black ground-truth cells, voltage axes in
mV, the same canvas and the same axes rectangle — so these panels and the
pipeline's own figures are the same pictures in the same clothes and can be
placed side by side in a paper.

WHICH figures get drawn, and for WHICH devices, is decided entirely by the
settings in scripts/run_1_generate_dataset.py (and re-runnable at any time
with scripts/run_5_render_device_figures.py).  Nothing here is mandatory:
turn everything off and the study runs exactly as before.

Note which figures depend on the measurement budget and which do not:

    charge_sensor, charge_sensor_gradient, stability_diagram
        properties of the DEVICE — identical in every configuration
    rays, rays_on_truth, measurement, ray_traces,
    all_rays_peaks_overlay, ml_measurement, summary_total,
    summary_total_all_crosses
        properties of the MEASUREMENT — they change with rays and points,
        which is why they live in the configuration folder and not in the
        shared device pool
