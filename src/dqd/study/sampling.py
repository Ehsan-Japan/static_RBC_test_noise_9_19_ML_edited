"""
sampling.py — WHERE the measurement points are put, at a fixed budget.

The budget study asks how MANY points are needed.  This module asks the other
question, the one the paper argues:

    given the SAME number of measured points, does it matter WHERE you put
    them — along a few directional sweeps, or spread over the diagram?

A "strategy" is a rule that turns a budget into a set of pixels to look at.
Everything downstream is untouched: each strategy produces exactly the same
Measurement object the rays produce, so the same channels, the same network,
the same training constants and the same metrics apply to all of them and a
difference in the result is a difference in WHERE the points were put and
nothing else.

    rays     the pipeline's own measurement: n_rays directional sweeps of
             n_points each, fired from the (max Vx, max Vy) corner
             (ml/ray_peaks.py — this is the real experiment)
    grid     N points on an evenly spaced lattice covering the whole diagram
    random   N pixels drawn uniformly at random, a different draw per device

with N = n_rays x n_points, the same number of points the rays get.

TWO HONEST NOTES ABOUT THE BUDGET

1. The rays are sampled at nearest grid cell, so two points on the same ray
   can land on the same pixel and neighbouring rays cross near the corner.
   The rays therefore end up visiting somewhat FEWER unique pixels than
   n_rays x n_points, while grid and random visit exactly their N.  The
   comparison reports the measured coverage of each strategy for that reason:
   if the rays win, they win from an equal or smaller number of pixels.

2. `grid` uses an nr x nc lattice with nr = round(sqrt(N)) and
   nc = round(N / nr), so the point count is N only when N factorises that
   way (it is exactly 100 for 5 x 20).  The actual count is reported, never
   assumed.

Peaks (channel 2, figures only) are detected on a ray's 1-D trace, which only
exists for `rays`; the scattered strategies leave that channel empty.  The
network never sees it — it is shown channels 0 and 1 — so this changes
nothing about what is being compared.
